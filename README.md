Caching Service Implementation in Java

This project implements a caching service in Java with the following features:

Configurable Maximum Elements: The cache can hold a configurable number of elements.
LRU Eviction Policy: When the cache exceeds its maximum size, it evicts the least recently used (LRU) element to the database.
Database Interaction: Evicted elements are saved to an in-memory database (InMemoryDatabase) and can be retrieved later.
Supported Operations: The caching service provides methods to add, remove, retrieve, and manage entities.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

Entity.java: Interface defining the structure of entities stored in the cache and database.
MyEntity.java: Concrete implementation of the Entity interface.
Database.java: Interface defining database operations.
TemporaryDatabase.java: In-memory implementation of the Database interface.
CachingService.java: Interface defining caching operations.
CachingServiceImpl.java: Implementation of the CachingService interface with LRU eviction policy.
Main.java: Test class demonstrating how to use the caching service.


How to Compile and Run the Code
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 11: Ensure you have JDK 11 installed on your machine.
Environment Setup: Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable and include the bin directory in your PATH.
Steps
Create a Project Directory

Create a new directory for your project.
Place all the .java files listed above in this directory.
Compile the Code

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run:

bash
Copy code
javac *.java
This command compiles all the .java files in the directory.
Ensure there are no compilation errors.
Run the Program

After successful compilation, run the Main class:

Output:
Retrieved e5: E5 Data
This output indicates that e5 was successfully retrieved from the in-memory database after being evicted from the cache.

Understanding the Caching Mechanism
LRU Cache Implementation
LinkedHashMap with Access Order: The cache is implemented using a LinkedHashMap with accessOrder set to true. This ensures that the entries are ordered based on the order of access, facilitating the LRU eviction policy.
Eviction Policy: When the cache exceeds its maximum size, the removeEldestEntry method is called, which evicts the least recently used entry. Before eviction, the entry is saved to the database.

Database Interaction
TemporaryDatabase: An in-memory database is used to simulate persistent storage. Evicted entities are saved here.
Data Retrieval: If an entity is not found in the cache, the service attempts to retrieve it from the database.
